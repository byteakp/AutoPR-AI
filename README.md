# AutoPR-AI
AutoPR-AI is an autonomous agent that automatically scans a GitHub repository for messy or inefficient code. It then uses an AI model to refactor and improve the identified files and finishes by creating a detailed pull request with the suggested enhancements for you to review and merge.
